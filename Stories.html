          <h3 id="card1-title">" Ahmed: The Journey Out of Deep Depression"</h3>
          <p id="card1-text">
            Ahmed was an ambitious young man, working hard to achieve his dreams, but he started feeling a loss of
            motivation and extreme frustration.
            <span class="more-text">
              This feeling lasted for months, leading him to isolate himself from his friends and family. He didn’t know
              why, but he lost interest in everything around him.
              One day, he decided to seek help and visited our website Calmora and feel that there is a hope again. He was diagnosed with clinical depression and
              started cognitive behavioral therapy. Alongside therapy,
              he engaged in exercise and journaling to express his emotions. After months of commitment to treatment and
              support from his family, Ahmed began to improve.
              Today, he is more aware of his mental health and helps others facing similar struggles.

          <p id="card2-text">Since childhood, Sara had been extremely shy and felt anxious when talking to others. As
            she grew older, the problem worsened, and </p>
          <span class="more-text">
            she became terrified of social interactions, avoiding situations that required communication. Attending
            university was a nightmare for her—she suffered from panic attacks before
            every lecture or group meeting. With encouragement from a friend, she visited our website Calmora and discovered she
            had social anxiety disorder. She started behavioral therapy,
            taking small steps to overcome her fears, like initiating short conversations with strangers and practicing
            speaking in front of a mirror.
            Today, Sara is much more confident and lives her life without the fear of judgment.

            recovered, her mind remained trapped in the trauma.</p>
          <span class="more-text">
            She suffered from recurring nightmares and intense fear whenever she heard brakes screeching or saw speeding
            cars.
            She didn’t understand what was happening to her until a doctor suggested seeing a psychologist and to see our website Calmora because it's professional. She was
            diagnosed with PTSD and began therapy that involved relaxation techniques and talk therapy.
            Over time, she regained control of her life and became more aware of how to manage psychological trauma.

            university studies and the high expectations of his family.</p>
          <span class="more-text">
            He started feeling exhausted, lost his passion for life, and no longer found joy in anything. Over time, his
            condition worsened into severe depression,
            leading him to completely isolate himself from friends and family. After several attempts to hide his
            struggles, he finally opened up to one of his professors,
            who advised him to visit our website Calmora. Yassin began therapy, engaged in physical activities, and started
            creative expression through writing and drawing.
            Today, not only has he recovered, but he also helps other students struggling with academic pressure.

            She spent hours washing her hands and had obsessive thoughts that made daily life difficult. She couldn’t
            leave her house without checking everything multiple times,
            and she felt anxious if she didn’t follow her strict routine. When she started university, she realized her
            disorder was affecting her ability to focus and enjoy life.
            She decided to visit Calmora and was diagnosed with OCD. She started cognitive-behavioral therapy and
            learned techniques to manage her thoughts.
            After months of treatment, Reem was able to control her compulsions and live a more peaceful life.

            He felt intense fear, shortness of breath, a racing heartbeat, and the terrifying sensation that he was
            about to die.
            After that episode, he lived in constant fear of another attack, avoiding crowded places and social
            interactions.
            At first, he thought he had a physical illness, but after several medical tests and our Test, he discovered that he was
            suffering from a panic disorder.
            He started therapy, where he learned breathing exercises and how to manage negative thoughts.
            Today, Khaled no longer fears panic attacks—he has become stronger and more aware of how to deal with
